# CQRS-ES-AWS
The fun project to create CQRS application with event sourcing using AWS managed services. The goal is also to have it as the serverless application. 

The goal is to use the AWS tools to create the serverless application, I didn't focus on the logic itself and used a lot of shortcuts just to create something quickly.
